NW School for Deaf &amp; Hard-of-Hearing Children project repo for SeattleGiveCamp 2017

# Organization Mission Statement 
For the past 35 years, Northwest School for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Children has been a leader in education for children with hearing loss. Each year, we serve approximately 200 Western Washington families with deaf and hard-of-hearing (D/HH) children. We strongly believe when families have the right support, children are set up to succeed in school and throughout life. We see this in the children we serve every single day.
Our mission is focused on three outcomes: grade level achievement; English proficiency; and oral communication and listening skills. We are committed to helping D/HH children become self-confident, articulate and academically competitive learners, and engaged community members. Our campus is located in Shoreline, WA.
